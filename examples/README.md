# RigC Examples

> Note: these examples will be changed often.

## Running

Make sure you've [built](https://github.com/PoetaKodu/rigc-lang/#-getting-started) the RigC virtual machine.

Then open a terminal in **the current folder** and run the following command:

```bash
../bin/x64/Debug/VM HelloWorld
```

This command will run the `HelloWorld` example using RigC's virtual machine.

To run other examples just replace `HelloWorld` with a filename of a different one (e.g. `AdvancedFunctionTemplates`).

### Working directory

Double-check that your terminal works on the current folder.
Some examples use modules that are specified relative to the working directory.
